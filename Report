# Twitter-sentiment- Project Report: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
1. Project Overview
 * Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. This involves classifying tweets as either positive or negative.
 * Key Technologies/Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for feature extraction, model selection, and metrics).
 * Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset of tweets for sentiment analysis. (Specifically, training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv).
2. Data Acquisition and Initial Setup
 * Kaggle Setup (Initial Attempts & Errors): The initial steps show attempts to set up Kaggle credentials and download data using the Kaggle API. There were issues with missing kaggle.json and KeyError: 'username', indicating problems with API key configuration.
 * File Upload and Extraction: A zip file (likely containing the dataset) was uploaded and successfully extracted to /content/.
 * NLTK Downloads: Essential NLTK packages like stopwords were downloaded for text preprocessing.
3. Data Loading and Exploration
 * Loading the Dataset: The tweet data was loaded using pandas.read_csv().
   * Initial attempts encountered SyntaxError: invalid syntax and ParserError: Error tokenizing data. This indicates issues with the CSV file format or the read_csv parameters.
   * Later successful loading likely involved specifying the correct encoding (encoding='latin-1') and potentially handling headers/column names explicitly.
 * Column Definition: The dataset columns were defined as ['target', 'id', 'date', 'flag', 'user', 'text'].
 * Data Inspection:
   * twitter_data.head() was used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame, showing the structure of the data (target, id, date, flag, user, text).
   * twitter_data.isnull().sum() was used to check for missing values, showing no missing values in the loaded dataset.
   * twitter_data['target'].value_counts() was used to inspect the distribution of the 'target' variable (sentiment labels). It showed a count of 21124 for a target value of 0 (likely negative sentiment).
 * Target Variable Transformation: The 'target' column, which likely contains numerical labels for sentiment, was transformed. Specifically, the value 4 was replaced with 1 (presumably to convert sentiment labels to a binary 0 for negative and 1 for positive).
4. Text Preprocessing (Stemming and Stopword Removal)
 * Stemming: The project uses Porter Stemmer for stemming, which is the process of reducing words to their root form.
   * An initial attempt to initialize PorterStemmer() had a syntax error.
 * Stopword Removal: English stopwords are used to remove common words that do not contribute much to the sentiment (e.g., "the", "a", "is").
 * stemming Function: A custom function named stemming was defined to encapsulate the text preprocessing steps:
   * Removing non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions (re.sub).
   * Converting text to lowercase.
   * Tokenizing the text (splitting into words).
   * Removing stopwords and applying stemming to each word.
   * Joining the processed tokens back into a string.
 * Applying Preprocessing to Data: The stemming function was applied to the 'text' column of the twitter_data DataFrame to create a new column, stemmed_content.
5. Further Steps (Implied/Planned based on Imports)
Based on the imported libraries (sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split, sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression, sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score), the subsequent steps in this project would typically involve:
 * Feature Extraction: Converting the preprocessed text data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a common technique for this.
 * Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
 * Model Training: Training a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) on the training data.
 * Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy score on the test data.
6. Challenges Encountered
 * Kaggle API configuration issues (kaggle.json and KeyError).
 * ParserError and SyntaxError during CSV loading, suggesting data formatting or parameter issues.
 * Minor syntax error during PorterStemmer initialization.
7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the initial crucial steps of a sentiment analysis pipeline, focusing on data acquisition, loading, and comprehensive text preprocessing (stemming and stopword removal). The successful implementation of these steps lays the foundation for building and evaluating machine learning models to classify tweet sentiment.
